# LinkedIn Clone Project
This is part of a [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaYts9sPmcY) where a front-end linkedin clone is developed. This version is slightly different, by following different design decisions and utilizes the latest version of firestore, instead of the previous version followed in the tutorial.
